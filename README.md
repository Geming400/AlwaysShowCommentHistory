Everytime you see a user's profile page, you will be able to check their comment history even if they disabled this feature *(because for some reason robtop didn't add a check for this)*

You can also quickly disable this mod from this mod's settings.

Original code from [qolmod](https://github.com/TheSillyDoggo/GeodeMenu/blob/e21637af2559d287b50ed92e8f3b400bdcbfe4c5/src/Hacks/CommentHistory.cpp) by [TheSillyDoggo](https://github.com/TheSillyDoggo), I just added my things to it.

Also **big** thank to [Alpha](https://github.com/Alphalaneous) who helped me fixing my dumb issues in `#dev-help`!
